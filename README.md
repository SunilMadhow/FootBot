# FootBot
An Arduino-based footballing robot of prodigious skill

FootBot is a robot driven on two independently controled motors, and aims to shoot a ball of random position into a goal of random position. This is accomplished by synthesizing visual imput from a Pixy camera and encoder readings to gather information on its surroundings and position.
